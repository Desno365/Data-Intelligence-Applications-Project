# Advertising and Social Influence project


## Assignment

Note: for more details on the assignment see the Advertising and Social Influence chapter in [project-proposals.pdf](https://github.com/Desno365/Data-Intelligence-Applications-Project/raw/main/project-proposals.pdf)

#### Description of the project

Consider the scenario in which an advertiser tries to activate a cascade in a social network by using sponsored ads. On the other side, the social network platform works as an ad publisher. The nodes of social networks can be of different categories and the activation probabilities depend on the categories of the nodes. [...]


## Usage

The runnable scripts used to run analyses and create plots are `step1.py`, `step3.py` and `step4_5_6.py`. Each script comes with a first section called "Constants" that includes variables which are used as settings for that particular analysis.<br>
There are also global settings that are stored in the variables contained in `constants.py`, for example there are stored the number of nodes in the network, the number of categories, the number of slots and many others global variables.

Also, there are runnable scripts in the `tests` folder that are used internally to check the correctness of the algorithms. For example the script `test_vcg_auction.py` contains some unit tests to check the correctness of the VCG Auction.
